## How to Read This Documentation

Welcome to the Fiscozen Design System documentation.

Here, you can find all the information you need to start using our components.

In the "@fiscozen" menu, you will find all the packages currently developed. Each package begins with **@fiscozen/** followed by the package name. Within a package, you will find all the components related to that package along with their documentation.

You can then use the documentation generated by Storybook to experiment with the components and see how they work.

The name of the component is also the tag you should use to import it and use the component in your project.

e.g.

```tsx
<template>
    <FzButton ... />
</template>
<script setup>
    import { FzButton } from '@fiscozen/button';
</script>
```
