# Design System AI Assistant Guidelines

## Task Approach

When given a task with Figma design reference:
1. First read the relevant component source files to understand current implementation
2. Check for similar components in `packages/` directory for patterns
3. Review Storybook stories to understand usage patterns and variants
4. Match Figma design to existing component props/variants or propose additions
5. Implement changes following component conventions
6. Write/update Storybook stories to reflect new features
7. Run affected tests before finishing

## Component Discovery Pattern

For any feature request, first find related components:
```bash
# Search for similar functionality
grep -r "keyword" packages/ --include="*.vue" --include="*.ts"

# List all components by category
ls apps/storybook/src/stories/
```

## Naming Conventions

- **Components**: `Fz{pascalCase}` (e.g., `FzButton`, `FzDialog`)
- **Packages**: `@fiscozen/{kebab-case}` (e.g., `@fiscozen/button`)
- **Files**: `Fz{ComponentName}.vue`, `Fz{ComponentName}.spec.ts`
- **Stories**: `{ComponentName}.stories.ts` in category folders

## Common Patterns

- All components use `<script setup lang="ts">`
- Props interfaces are in `src/types.ts`
- Exports from `src/index.ts`
- Styles use Tailwind CSS with design tokens
- Two environments: `backoffice` and `frontoffice`
