# DESIGN SYSTEM

## Development
### Node.js
In order to ensure the same version of Node.js runtime is used by the developers we encourage the usage of [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). Windows users can look at [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).

In order to install the correct version of Node.js run
```
nvm install
nvm use
```
inside the project directory.

### NPM client
We handle dependencies with `pnpm`. Please refer to its [documentation](https://pnpm.io/it/installation) in order to install it in the local development machine.

### Dependency installation
Run `pnpm install`.
