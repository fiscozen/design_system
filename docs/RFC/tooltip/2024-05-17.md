## Summary

Tooltip component for the design system

## Motivation

As developers we would like to have a component that allows us to show tooltip on mouseover on every element on the page.

## Detailed design

### Notes about implementation

- the component is a wrapper around the `FzFloating` component
- positioning of a tooltip is based on 3 elements: the opening element, the container, and the tooltip "bubble" itself. Positioning of the tooltip relies heavily on [getBoundingClientRect](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect) browser API.
- as a future possible improvement we could use the [intersection observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) in order to achieve dynamic positioning.
