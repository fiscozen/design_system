## Summary

This document outlines the design for a Card component intended for a web application.

## Motivation

The primary application requires a Card component. This component should encapsulate the UI logic as expressed in the following [Figma component](https://www.figma.com/design/tqDILjLuuGCXICMbLrzxB4/Design-System?node-id=1557-110906&t=rlRZpw66LG7IW7zW-0).


## Detailed design

We will provide a Card component that handles the layout of the card but does not handle the content of the card. The component will be styled according to the Figma specifications. 
### Props

| Name           | Type         | Default | Required | Description                                                   |
|----------------|--------------|---------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Title          | string       |         | Yes      | Title to display at the top of the card                       |
| color          | `blue \| orange \| purple` |         | No       | Color of the card                               |
| primary-action | ActionButtonObject |         | No       | If set, the card will create a primary action button          |
| secondary-action | ActionButtonObject |         | No       | If set, the card will create a secondary action button        |
| tertiary-action | ActionIconObject |         | No       | If set, the card will create a tertiary action button.         |
| content-class  | string       |         | No       | Class to apply to the content of the card                      |

```typescript

interface ActionButtonObject {
  label: string;
}

interface ActionIconObject {
  icon: string;
}

```

These interface may be extended in the future to include more options.

primary-action and secondary-action will be buttons with a label. tertiary-action will be a button with an icon. 

If tertiary-action is set, also the secondary-action and primary-action should be set. The same goes for secondary-action, if secondary-action is set, primary-action should be set. Only primary-action can be set without the other actions.

### Emits

| Name           | Description                                                               |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| click:primary| Emitted when the primary action button is clicked.                        |
| click:secondary | Emitted when the secondary action button is clicked.                      |
| click:tertiary | Emitted when the tertiary action button is clicked.                        |

### Slots

| Name           | Description                                                               |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| default        | Slot that contains the content of the card                                |


### Responsiveness considerations
The card should adapt to the content inside it. The final user can personalize the style of the card using class or content-class in order to get the desired result.
