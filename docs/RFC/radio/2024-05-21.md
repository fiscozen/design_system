## Summary

Radio and Radio Group for the design system


## Motivation

The main application needs a radio and radiogroup component. It should encapsulate the UI logic expressed in the following [Figma component](https://www.figma.com/design/tqDILjLuuGCXICMbLrzxB4/Design-System?node-id=1557-110724&t=vzm6bwyyOcx5Z3xI-0) and [Figma component](https://www.figma.com/design/tqDILjLuuGCXICMbLrzxB4/Design-System?node-id=1557-110741&t=vzm6bwyyOcx5Z3xI-0).

## Detailed design

We will provide two components: `radio` and `radiogroup`.
The first one is a simple wrapper around the native radio, styled according to the design system.
The second one implements the radio group, which is a group of radio that are mutually exclusive. They share a common label , common help text and common error message.
