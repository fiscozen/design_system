## Summary
Dialog component for the Design System

## Motivation
This component is needed for all dialog pattern uses in a web application.

## Detailed design
[figma](https://www.figma.com/design/tqDILjLuuGCXICMbLrzxB4/Design-System?node-id=1258-7282&m=dev)

This component wraps the native `<dialog>` element in order to leverage its accessibility. It provides slots for the header, body and footer sections already styled as prescribed by the design system.
Default dialogs for common operations are available.

## Drawbacks
Native elements are subject to browser-specific behaviors, therefore thorough testing will be needed in order to make sure that look and feel is the same across implementations.
