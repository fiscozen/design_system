## Summary

This document outlines the design for a Tab component intended for a web application.

## Motivation

The primary application requires a Tab component. This component should encapsulate the UI logic as expressed in the following [Figma component](https://www.figma.com/file/tqDILjLuuGCXICMbLrzxB4/Design-System?type=design&node-id=120-24659&mode=dev).


## Detailed design

We aim to provide two components responsible for creating and managing the logic behind a typical tab use case. The components are as follows:

1. Tabs: This component's role is to manage the transition between various tabs.
2. Tab: This component contains the tab's name and its content.

The Tabs component use an uncontrolled approach to manage the selected tab. The initial selected tab is the first tab that has the initial-selected property set to true. If no tab has the initialSelected property set to true, the first tab is selected by default. Then the state is managed internally by the Tabs component.

In the future, we may consider adding a controlled approach to manage the selected tab, maybe by creating a ControlledTabs component.

| disabled       | boolean      | false   | No       | If set to true, the tab is disabled.                          |
| initial-selected| boolean      | false   | No       | If set to true, the tab is selected.                          |


### Slots

Tabs:
| Name           | Description                                                   |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| default        | List of tab items                                             |

Tab:
| Name           | Description                                                   |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| default        | The content displayed when the tab is selected.               |


### Responsiveness considerations
In line with the Figma specifications, we will provide a different overflow mechanism based on the horizontal-overflow property. By default, the tab displays as a picker when overflowing. If set to true, the tab displays as a standard tab with horizontal scroll.

### Accessibility considerations
All tabs should be navigable and selectable using the keyboard. Accessibility of the components inside of the tab should be addressed by themselves.

## Drawbacks and alternatives
The overflow mechanism changes based on the horizontal-overflow property. This means that the developer must be aware of the property's implications when using the component.
