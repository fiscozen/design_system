## Summary

Alert are a callout that helps provide additional, timely, and useful information to the user regarding their current page or events.

## Motivation

## Detailed design

The alert component can be rendered in one of three different styles:

- Default: Has a title, a description a button and a solid background
- Collapsable: Same as default but also has a button to collapse the alert which hides the description and button
- Simple: Only has a description

It can also be rendered in one of four different types: Info, Danger, Warning, Success.
